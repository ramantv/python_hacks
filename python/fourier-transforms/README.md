Including

* How to scale the x- and y-axis in the amplitude spectrum
* Leakage Effect
* Windowing

### [Take a look at the IPython Notebook](./FFT-Tutorial.ipynb)

Fourier analysis is a method for expressing a function as a sum of periodic components, and for recovering the signal from those components. When both the function and its Fourier transform are replaced with discretized counterparts, it is called the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).
